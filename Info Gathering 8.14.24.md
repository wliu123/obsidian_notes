1. Business Model and Operations:

- What types of goods will you be shipping?
	- Items will come from the warehouse. So far only a contract with 1 warehouse
- What are the main stages in your delivery process, from order placement to final delivery? 
	- Warehouse prepares set delivery of goods for the following day. Main guy distributes how many packages will be delivered by which driver. In the case of an emergency delivery, another driver will be allocated to pickup the packages in need. When drivers are at the warehouse, they should be able to scan the barcodes of each package and have it show in the app the delivery information (client name, address, delivery location, additional comments) and should have a batch of all the packages to be delivered that day. When driver begins to deliver a package, he/she should be able to start the drive by saying i'm on my way and it should navigate to the clients address. Nice to have: When batches of packages to be delivered are placed within the app, they should be sorted by the distance closest to current location to furthest and the next delivery route would always be the next closest destination. Once the package is delivered to the address, the driver should be able to take a photo to confirm the package has been delivered to the requested location and the photo and delivery confirmation should be sent to the warehouse to notify the client. There should be a complete delivery slider or button to trigger this scenario.
- What's your target delivery area (local, regional, national, international)?
	- regional
- What's the typical delivery timeframes for orders?
	- This is not extremely mandatory but best to have pickup time and date and estimated time of arrival. Estimated time of arrival can be taken from the estimated arrival time provided by maps plus a fixed amount of time to give leeway.
- How will you prioritize and schedule deliveries?
	- Deliveries are set by nearest locations to warehouse and furthest.
- What kind of communication do you want to maintain with customers during delivery process?
	- I want to be able to chat with the customers during the delivery process or call them because there are times I'm unable to find the delivery location or I need the pincode to enter the apartment building or gate.

2. Fleet Management

- Will there be other drivers besides the 3 of you?
- How will you manage the fleet for delivery?
- How do you want to assign drivers to specific routes or deliveries?
	- All the deliveries for the day will first be assigned to the main lead and then the main lead will separate out the deliveries as needed.
- Should there be a built in map for navigation or drivers use their own navigation system?
	- Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze

2. Clientele:

- Who is your target customer base (individuals, businesses, or both)?
	- App is for the drivers
- What is the driver-customer flow?
	- When driver picks up the package from a warehouse, the driver will scan the label which provides all the client information. The number of users of the app being used simultaneously is dependent on how many packages are needed to be picked up and will be divided amongst the drivers.

3. App Features:

- Do you need real-time tracking for customers and internal use?
	- Customers do not need real-time tracking of packages like fedex and such.
- Should the app include a customer registration and login system?
	- No
- Is route optimization important for your drivers?
	- At the moment no
- Should the app support multiple languages?
	- Mandarin and English

4. Integration:

- Do you need the app to integrate with any existing systems (e.g., inventory management, CRM)?
	- This will most likely need to be able to integrate with the warehouse API in order to get the necessary information regarding the delivery.
- Will you require API integration with third-party services?

5. Scalability:

- How many users do you expect in the first year? In five years?

6. Security:

- What level of data security do you require?
- Do you need to comply with any specific regulations?

7. Budget and Timeline:

- What's your budget range for app development?
- When do you plan to launch your business, and by when do you need the app?

8. Maintenance and Updates:

- Are you interested in ongoing support and maintenance after the initial launch?
- How often do you anticipate needing updates or new features?

Regarding costs and maintenance fees, these can vary widely based on the complexity of the app and the features required. Here's a general breakdown:

1. Development costs:

- Basic app: $10,000 - $50,000
- Medium complexity: $50,000 - $120,000
- Complex app with advanced features: $120,000+

2. Ongoing maintenance:

- Basic maintenance: $500 - $1,000 per month
- More complex systems: $1,000 - $5,000+ per month

App should work like an uber eats delivery. Location package was placed. Live chat is needed to speak with the customer for gate code or apartment code. No customer service needed. If theres emergency packages to be sent then will find another driver. Warehouse typically splits the packages that need to be separated and delivered by drivers the day before. After the driver drops off the package, should be able to take a picture and write a note of where the package is located and it should probably go to the warehouse which then gets pushed to the customer.
