This note will serve as the central hub for the overall project. The purpose of this project is to create a delivery application for one of our clients. The clients business has not gotten off the ground yet but is in talks with a warehouse to sign a contract to be the sole drivers for the organization. The client initially wanted to use the app provided by the warehouse, but the warehouse app has been in development for almost 2 years now with no signs of completion and informed him to go through a manual process which would've been a big hassle, thus the client is looking for an app to be built for the drivers. The app should work similar to delivery apps for drivers where the product is received with customer information displayed -> driver navigates to the customer destination -> driver is able to see additional information regarding delivery such as pincodes, delivery instructions, etc -> driver should be able to chat or call the customer if additional questions are needed -> when driver drops the package off they should be able to take a photo and mark if complete or not complete along with reason
