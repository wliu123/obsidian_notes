[[Architecture Design]]
[[User Interface Design]]
[[User Experience Design]]
## 1. Architecture

1.1 [ ] Implement a client-server architecture
1.2 [ ] Use RESTful API for communication between client and server
1.3 [ ] Implement offline-first architecture to support areas with poor connectivity

## 2. Frontend Development

2.1 [ ] Develop a cross-platform mobile application
   - Suggested framework: React Native or Flutter for code reusability
2.2 [ ] Implement responsive design for various mobile screen sizes
2.3 [ ] Support offline mode with local data storage and synchronization

## 3. Backend Development

3.1 [ ] Develop a scalable server-side application
   - Suggested technologies: Node.js with Express.js or Django (Python)
3.2 [ ] Implement RESTful API endpoints for all required functionalities
3.3 [ ] Implement User Authentication

## 4. Database

4.1 [ ] Use a relational database for structured data (e.g., PostgreSQL)
4.2 [ ] Design database schema to efficiently store and retrieve:
   - User profiles
   - Package information
   - Delivery status
   - Customer data
## 5. Authentication and Security

5.1 [ ] Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
5.2 [ ] Use HTTPS for all client-server communications
5.3 [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data storage
5.4 [ ] Follow OWASP guidelines for security best practices

## 6. Third-Party Integrations

6.1 [ ] Integrate mapping and navigation services API
   - Options: Google Maps API, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap
6.2 [ ] Implement barcode scanning functionality
   - Consider using libraries like react-native-camera or expo-barcode-scanner
6.3 [ ] Integrate with warehouse management system API
6.4 [ ] Integrate with AWS s3 for photo storage

## 8. Localization

8.1 [ ] Implement i18n (internationalization) to support English and Mandarin
8.2 [ ] Design the app to handle different character sets and text directions

## 9. Data Synchronization

9.1 [ ] Implement efficient data sync mechanism for offline-online transitions
9.2 [ ] Use background sync for uploading delivery photos and status updates

## 10. Performance Optimization (Future)

10.1 [ ] Implement lazy loading for optimal app performance
10.2 [ ] Use caching strategies to minimize data usage and improve load times
10.3 [ ] Optimize images and assets for mobile devices

## 11. Analytics and Monitoring (Future)

11.1 [ ] Integrate analytics tools for tracking app usage and performance
    - Consider using tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel
11.2 [ ] Implement error logging and monitoring
    - Options: Sentry, Bugsnag, or ELK stack

## 12. Testing

12.1 [ ] Implement unit testing for both frontend and backend
12.2 [ ] Set up integration testing for API endpoints
12.3 [ ] Perform usability testing with a focus on driver experience

## 13. Deployment and DevOps

13.1 [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
13.2 [ ] Use containerization (Docker) for consistent development and deployment environments
13.3 [ ] Implement load balancing for improved scalability

## 14. Backup and Disaster Recovery (Future)

14.1 [ ] Implement regular automated backups of all data
14.2 [ ] Design and implement a disaster recovery plan

## Considerations and Open Questions

- [ ] Determine the level of end-to-end encryption needed for user data protection
- [ ] Decide on the approach for handling app updates (force update or optional)
- [ ] Evaluate the need for a web-based admin panel for warehouse staff
